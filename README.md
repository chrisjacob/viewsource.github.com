# [viewsource.github.com](http://viewsource.github.com) - Open Source GitHub Pages CDN

An extensive archive of popular - and less popular - open source projects.

Useful for when you're prototyping e.g. on http://jsbin.com or http://jsfiddle.net and you need to pull in some common library / resource. 

The URLs are dead simple to remember...

http://viewsource.github.com/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.js

**Tip:** If you go to http://viewsource.github.com/jquery it will redirect you to GitHub to see what versions we've got archived... use GitHub to explore what files are in the CDN!

Also a dynamic "latest" version is supported - for when you want to test against whatever the most recently released version is.

http://viewsource.github.com/jquery/latest/jquery.js

**Tip:** Simply `fork` this project to host your own GitHub Pages CDN.
